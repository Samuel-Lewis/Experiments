#### [TicTacToe ML](https://github.com/Samuel-Lewis/Experiments/tree/master/TicTacToe%20ML)
*Experiment*  
First attempt at something machine learning based. A game of Tic Tac Toe, human vs AI, where the more you play, the more the AI learns *how* you play. After every game, the AI rewards its decisions based on what the final results were, which then influence future decisions.  
**To use:** Download the repo, and the [lunchbox toolset](https://github.com/Samuel-Lewis/lunchbox). Put `lunchbox` in the libs directory of `TicTacToe ML`. Then compile using `make` in root. Run and play!  
**Dependencies:** [lunchbox](https://github.com/Samuel-Lewis/lunchbox)

`HIA BEGIN_THAT VISIBLE "Hello World" TLDR EH KTHXBYE END_THAT` . Legitmate C++ "Hello World" program. A selection of silly macros to spice up your project.  
**To use:** Include `lolz.h` in your code, and you're set.  
**Dependencies:** A bad sense of humour
